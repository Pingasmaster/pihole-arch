# pihole-arch

A guide on how to install pihole with unbound on arch linux. Everyrthing works just fine, except the web server. For those who wants just the code, check out the `code.sh` file.

## TLDR: just the complete code

To install pihole:

```
sudo pacman -Syu --needed help2man git m4 perl make automake autoconf gcc base-devel fakeroot wget
mkdir build
cd build/
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pi-hole-server.git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/logrotate-git.git
cd logrotate-git
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf logrotate-git/

To set everything up with unbound:

__Don't forget to replace `192.168.0.0/24` with your own set of private ips.__

```
sudo pacman -S unbound
sudo cat << EOF > /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
server:
    # If no logfile is specified, syslog is used
    # logfile: "/var/log/unbound/unbound.log"
    verbosity: 0

    interface: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5335
    do-ip4: yes
    do-udp: yes
    do-tcp: yes

    # May be set to yes if you have IPv6 connectivity
    do-ip6: no

    # You want to leave this to no unless you have *native* IPv6. With 6to4 and
    # Terredo tunnels your web browser should favor IPv4 for the same reasons
    prefer-ip6: no

    # Use this only when you downloaded the list of primary root servers!
    # If you use the default dns-root-data package, unbound will find it automatically
    #root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"

    # Trust glue only if it is within the server's authority
    harden-glue: yes

    # Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone becomes BOGUS
    harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

    # Don't use Capitalization randomization as it known to cause DNSSEC issues sometimes
    # see https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unbound-stubby-or-dnscrypt-proxy/9378 for further details
    use-caps-for-id: no

    # Reduce EDNS reassembly buffer size.
    # IP fragmentation is unreliable on the Internet today, and can cause
    # transmission failures when large DNS messages are sent via UDP. Even
    # when fragmentation does work, it may not be secure; it is theoretically
    # possible to spoof parts of a fragmented DNS message, without easy
    # detection at the receiving end. Recently, there was an excellent study
    # >>> Defragmenting DNS - Determining the optimal maximum UDP response size for DNS <<<
    # by Axel Koolhaas, and Tjeerd Slokker (https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/36/contributions/776/)
    # in collaboration with NLnet Labs explored DNS using real world data from the
    # the RIPE Atlas probes and the researchers suggested different values for
    # IPv4 and IPv6 and in different scenarios. They advise that servers should
    # be configured to limit DNS messages sent over UDP to a size that will not
    # trigger fragmentation on typical network links. DNS servers can switch
    # from UDP to TCP when a DNS response is too big to fit in this limited
    # buffer size. This value has also been suggested in DNS Flag Day 2020.
    edns-buffer-size: 1232

    # Perform prefetching of close to expired message cache entries
    # This only applies to domains that have been frequently queried
    prefetch: yes

    # One thread should be sufficient, can be increased on beefy machines. In reality for most users running on small networks or on a single machine, it should be unnecessary to seek performance enhancement by increasing num-threads above 1.
    num-threads: 1

    # Ensure kernel buffer is large enough to not lose messages in traffic spikes
    so-rcvbuf: 1m

    # Ensure privacy of local IP ranges, here replace 192.168.0.0/24 with your range of private ips!
    private-address: 192.168.0.0/24
EOF
sudo systemctl restart unbound
# Set dns to unbound
pihole -a setdns 127.0.0.1#5335
```

How to configure your install without the web interface:

* Set the DNS server of pihole with `pihole -a setdns 127.0.0.1#5335`

* Set your new password for the web interface with `pihole -a -p password`

* Remove preinstalled blocklists with `rm -rf /etc/pihole/gravity* && pihole -g`

* Disable logging and increase privacy level with

 ```
 pihole logging off
 cat << EOF >> /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf
 PRIVACYLEVEL=3
 EOF
 ```
 
* Get new blocklists from the internet

 ```
 # Put all blocklist that are green on firebog.net onto pihole, for all green and blue blocklists (but not crossed ones) replace "?type=tick" by "?type=nocross"
sudo wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick |xargs -I {} sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "INSERT INTO adlist (Address) VALUES ('{}');"
# To add any blocklist type that and replace https://dbl.oisd.nl/ by the blocklist address
sudo echo "https://dbl.oisd.nl/" |xargs -I {} sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "INSERT INTO adlist (Address) VALUES ('{}');"
pihole -g
pihole restartdns
 ```

## Why ?

Pihole is a software that allows you to host your own DNS server. It is usefull for security, privacy and responsiveness. iF you want to check out the original project, [go give them a star](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole). Arch linux isn't supported by the official installer, and I only deploy servers on arch so I needed to find a way.

## How ?

Turns out there is a [pihole package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-server) in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) repositories, and even a page [on how to setup pihole](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pi-hole) on the ArchWiki!
We need to install all its dependencies, and then to build it, and to set up our server.

## The code

We first need to install all the packages that we will need to build packages later on. These are all dependencies or software we need to build our code (some are optionnal dependencies but required for our use case). `git` is used to clone repositories, so it is not stricly necessary but it is used for convenience here.

```
sudo pacman -S --needed help2man git m4 perl wget make automake autoconf gcc base-devel
```

Then, we will create a new folder and cd into it to keep our workflow clean and organized.

```
mkdir build
cd build/
```

Now clone the [pihole packet](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-server) repository from aur:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pi-hole-server.git
```

Get the first dependency and build it. Execute the code as an user, not as root (makepkg do not like root).

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/logrotate-git.git
cd logrotate-git
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf logrotate-git/
```

And install all the dependencies. You should search for `arch packet packetname` in your favorite search engine and grab the most up to date version, it helps a lot as all these packets are not present on the aur!

```
# Get dependencies
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/community/os/x86_64/jq-1.6-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/extra/os/x86_64/gnu-netcat-0.7.1-9-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/core/os/x86_64/inetutils-2.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/extra/os/x86_64/lsof-4.98.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/extra/os/x86_64/bind-9.18.11-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
wget https://mirror.dkm.cz/archlinux/extra/os/x86_64/bc-1.07.1-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
# Install them
sudo pacman -U *.pkg.tar.zst
# Remove the leftovers files
rm -rf *pkg.tar.zst
```

Build the lasts dependencies with this:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/patch-git.git
cd patch-git
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf patch-git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/pi-hole-ftl.git
cd pi-hole-ftl
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf pi-hole-ftl
```

And finally, build the pihole server packet and erase all the leftovers:

```
cd pi-hole-server
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf pi-hole-server
cd ..
rm -rf build
```

Then we will start installing unbound, configuring it properly and setting everything up in pihole for it to work!
